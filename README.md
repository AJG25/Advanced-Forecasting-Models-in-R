# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA, ETS, and Decomposition Methods in R

This project focuses on advanced time series forecasting using various models, including ARIMA, ETS, and STL decomposition. The analysis focuses on datasets from different domains, including Olympic sprint times, global population, GDP, tourism, and industrial production.

## Objectives
- Model time series data using ARIMA, ETS, and decomposition methods (STL, Holt-Winters)
- Compare forecasting models based on accuracy and residual diagnostics
- Forecast future values and evaluate assumptions (e.g., stationarity, transformations)

## Tools & Libraries
- **Language:** R
- **Libraries:** fpp3, ggplot2, dplyr, tsibble, feasts, forecast

## Project Highlights
- **Olympic Sprint Times (1896–2016):** Visualized winning times and forecasted 2020 Olympic results.
- **Afghanistan Population Trends:** Analyzed population data and compared trend models.
- **Tourism Arrivals (1981–2012):** Compared multiple time series models for tourism data.
- **U.S. GDP Forecasting:** Applied ARIMA and ETS models, including Box-Cox transformations.
- **Australian Industrial Production:** Forecasted industrial production and assessed model accuracy.

## Techniques Used
- Regression modeling
- Time series decomposition (STL)
- ARIMA modeling
- Exponential smoothing (ETS, Holt-Winters)
- Box-Cox transformation
- Forecast accuracy evaluation (RMSE, MAE)

## Key Takeaways
This project showcases the application of advanced time series forecasting methods across diverse datasets. Techniques such as ARIMA modeling, exponential smoothing, and STL decomposition were used to build and compare models. Data transformations, including Box-Cox, and stationarity checks were employed to ensure robust model fitting. Forecast accuracy was evaluated using metrics like RMSE and MAE, and residual diagnostics helped validate model assumptions. Clear visualizations supported the interpretation and communication of results.
